Drug Safety Analysis
Objective: Analyzed drug usage patterns concerning age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratios (Na/K) to enhance drug safety and healthcare interventions.

Key Insights:

Demographics: Middle-aged individuals (40-50 years) represent the majority.
Health Indicators:
High prevalence of hypertension and high cholesterol levels, especially in older individuals.
Na/K ratios suggest generally healthy dietary habits, with areas for improvement.
Drug Usage: DrugY is the most prescribed, with Drugs A and B underutilized.
Recommendations:

Implement targeted health campaigns for middle-aged and older populations.
Promote lifestyle changes like low-sodium diets and exercise.
Evaluate less-prescribed drugs for efficacy and market demand.
Use inclusive gender-specific health strategies and nutritional guidelines.
Modeling Approach:
Decision Tree and Random Forest models were applied, achieving high predictive performance (RÂ² = 0.989). The Random Forest model is recommended for its balanced accuracy and generalization capabilities.

Deliverables: Data insights, visualizations, and actionable recommendations to improve drug safety and optimize healthcare strategies.
